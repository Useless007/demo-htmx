# Specification Quality Checklist: ระบบการจัดการสต็อกสินค้าอย่างง่าย

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - PASS: Spec avoids mentioning frameworks, languages, or specific APIs. Example: "This spec intentionally avoids implementation details (databases, frameworks, UI libraries)."
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - PASS: User stories and success criteria are written in user/business terms (e.g., P1: add & view products).
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - PASS: Language is non-technical and explains value and acceptance scenarios in plain language.
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - PASS: Required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Key Entities, Success Criteria) are present.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - PASS: No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` tokens found.
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - PASS: Each FR includes an explicit test or check (examples in FR-001..FR-008).
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - PASS: SC items include measurable targets (e.g., replay 100 transactions, 95% search correctness).
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - PASS: Success criteria are expressed in user/business terms and do not name specific technologies.
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - PASS: Each primary user story has explicit acceptance scenarios under "Acceptance Scenarios".
- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - PASS: Edge Cases section lists duplication, negative qty, concurrent edits, and invalid input handling.
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - PASS: Assumptions and Dependencies explicitly bound MVP scope (no permissions, no external integrations).
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - PASS: Dependencies and Assumptions sections list persistence and UI scope.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - PASS: Each FR includes a concise test or verification step (see FR-001..FR-008).
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - PASS: P1/P2/P3 cover create/view/adjust/edit/search flows.
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - PASS: Success criteria exist and are verifiable as written.
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - PASS: Spec focuses on behavior and data shapes, not implementation.

## Validation Summary

- Overall result: PASS — specification meets the quality checklist.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were used. No critical gaps identified that block planning.

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` (none currently).

## Clarification Integration Notes (2025-10-08)

- The interactive clarification session decisions have been applied to `spec.md` and the referenced FRs and entities.
- Key policy decisions:
  - Oversell: Disallowed — when on-hand is insufficient create `StockReservation` instead of decrementing on-hand below zero.
  - Role: Inventory Manager is the primary actor for manual overrides and large fulfillment actions.
  - Fulfillment: Hybrid model — auto-fulfill reservations under a threshold (configurable), manual approval for larger reservations.
  - Concurrency: DB-level locking/transaction serialization recommended; operations should be idempotent where possible.

Status: PASS — clarifications integrated; spec ready for `/speckit.plan` to produce an implementation plan.
