# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

- Language/Runtime: Bun (JavaScript/ES2022); prefer Bun v1.x-compatible APIs. The existing demo scaffold uses Bun and Bun's sqlite bindings.
- Primary Dependencies: none additional for MVP beyond Bun runtime and HTMX (served via CDN). Use builtin `bun:sqlite` for DB access.
- Storage: SQLite file at `data/app.db` with transactional semantics. Schema managed via simple migration script included in implementation tasks.
- Testing: `bun test` for unit tests and small integration scripts; simple curl-based smoke tests for endpoints.
- Target Platform: Linux (development & demo host). The constitution expects this is acceptable for demo deployments.
- Project Type: Web application (backend + server-rendered HTMX frontend).
- Performance Goals: Demo target: <100 concurrent users; p95 UI interactions <500ms. No heavy scale requirements for MVP.
- Constraints: Must provide append-only audit log for transactions and support DB-level transaction serialization to satisfy FR-011.
- Scale/Scope: MVP supports up to ~10k products and demonstration-level concurrency; larger scale requires migration to RDBMS like Postgres.

## Constitution Check

GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.

Based on `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (version 0.1.0):

- Data Accuracy & Reconciliation: PASS — research chooses SQLite with append-only transactions and keeps audit logs; plan includes reconciliation tests.
- Test-First for Critical Flows: PASS — spec includes acceptance tests for P1 and reconciliation (SC-002). Phase 1 will include test harness notes.
- Minimal Governance: PASS — no heavy approvals required for demo; plan will include migration/reconciliation notes for schema changes.

Result: Constitution gates satisfied for Phase 0 → proceed.

### Source Code (repository root)

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

```

**Structure Decision**: Use a single web application layout with a `src/` code layout for new modules: `src/models/`, `src/db/`, `src/services/`, and keep `index.js` as a lightweight entrypoint at repo root. Static UI remains under `public/` and DB file under `data/`. Add `tests/` for unit/integration.

## Phase 0: Research

Artifacts generated: `research.md` (this file), which resolved runtime, storage, auth stub, retention, and testing choices. No remaining `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` items.

### Output locations

- research.md: `specs/001-/research.md`
- data model: `specs/001-/data-model.md`
- contracts: `specs/001-/contracts/openapi.yaml`
- quickstart: `specs/001-/quickstart.md`

Phase 0 complete: research findings recorded in `research.md` and used to resolve open clarifications. No remaining `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` tokens in the spec.

## Phase 1: Design

Artifacts produced in Phase 1 (drafts):

- `specs/001-/data-model.md` — entity definitions, validation rules, and state transitions for Product, StockTransaction, and StockReservation.
- `specs/001-/contracts/openapi.yaml` — REST endpoints for product CRUD, transactions, and reservations; includes header-based demo auth scheme.
- `specs/001-/quickstart.md` — instructions to run the Bun demo and manual tests.

Agent context updated for `copilot` to include the new feature artifacts.

## Constitution Re-check (post-design)

- Data Accuracy & Reconciliation: PASS — data model retains an append-only transaction log and includes reconciliation guidance (data-model.md)
- Test-First for Critical Flows: PASS — quickstart and plan include acceptance checks for P1 and reconciliation tests.

Result: No constitution gate failures. Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (task breakdown) with `/speckit.tasks`.
